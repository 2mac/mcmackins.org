In this video, we cover variables, data types, and user input. A quick summary:
variables are a way to store values for later use, Python 3 has five basic
types, each useful in their own way, and you can use the `input()` function to
get string input straight from the user each time you run.

We also create our second program which tells the user what year it will be
when they are double their current age.
