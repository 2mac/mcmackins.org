In this video, we learn to read and write files on the disk. We also improve
our password system by storing the users and passwords in a data file to be
loaded each time the program starts so that the environment is not reset each
time the program exits.

I made mention in the video to [this section of the Python documentation][1] to
learn more about what functions are available in file objects.

You can find all the code [here](/res/python-tutorials/code/05.tar.gz).
