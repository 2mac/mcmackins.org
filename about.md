About Me
========

<img src="/res/photos/tv-star.png" alt="[Photo]"/>

My name is David McMackins.

I'm a free/libre software developer. I program in C, Python (3), Lua, C++, and
Java. I also have exposure to Scheme, Emacs Lisp, Vala, Pascal, and
Prolog. Most of my important work will be done under the name Delwink, a
software development company dedicated to creating quality software which
respects your freedom. Check it out over at
[delwink.com](https://delwink.com). You may also find my personal code on
[GitHub](https://github.com/2mac).

I used to be an associate member of the Free Software Foundation, and I'm still
an activist in the free software community. I frequently send e-mails to the
people I subscribe and listen to across the Internet both to inform and learn
about the ideals and advantages of free software. If you'd like to know how I
became interested in free software, click [here](/stories/fsf.html). If you'd
like to join the FSF, please click my member number above to give me credit for
referring you.

I spend a lot of my time working and interacting with the Jupiter Broadcasting
community. A good deal of my free time is spent in their Mumble lobby.

How I do computing
------------------

I currently run Debian GNU/Linux as my primary operating system. This 
server runs Debian GNU/Linux 8 "Jessie" on an OVH VPS.

My personal computer runs Debian GNU/Linux Sid (rolling release) using the
GNOME 3 desktop environment. I mostly use Emacs for programming.

If you'd like to switch to free software, click [here](/switch). If you'd like
to switch on your own but with a little bit of hand holding, 
[contact me](/contact.html).

I don't use Facebook for reasons you can find [here][1]. I do have a Twitter 
account that I barely use: [@TheMcMackins][2]. You can find me on [Quitter][3],
@2mac.
