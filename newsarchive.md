### More retro goodness (August 6, 2018)

I've been trying on-and-off since 2016 to get my late 90s laptop running

show off my setup and give the steps on how it's done.

### My first math paper (October 3, 2017)

I recently encountered a scenario in a class I'm taking where there was a big
argument about what should be done with unfair questions on an exam. The
discussion appeared to be entirely centered on intuition and emotions, so I
decided to settle the matter with mathematics. I think this information could
be useful to teachers in a similar predicament.

### Decoding PowerPaint's custom image format (August 20, 2016)

I've been playing with [FreeDOS](http://www.freedos.org) for a little while
now, and I installed a little paint program from the 90s on it. One image just
belonged on the Internet, so I decided to convert it to an image format used by
today's image-viewing software.

### Retro awesomeness (June 8, 2016)

I've been writing a standard C library for the Nintendo Game Boy system over at
Delwink, and now I've got a working Pong prototype game. It still needs some
more features yet to be added to the library, but it's a playable game! Check
it out [on GitHub](https://github.com/2mac/gbpong), or clone
`https://github.com/2mac/gbpong.git`.

### Fun for hackers (May 28, 2015)

I made a new program in response to a challenge, and it has turned out to be a

`https://github.com/2mac/ttt.git` using Git to check it out. Be sure to first
read the README file before getting started.

computer operating system.

### New Article: Free Distros Aren't For Suckers! (October 6, 2014)

as people like to make them out to be.

### iDad Experiment Results (May 7, 2014)

Yesterday was defectivebydesign.org's International Day Against DRM. I was going
to make a post here or a YouTube video, but a guy from the Jupiter Broadcasting
Mumble lobby had a better idea.

### Article: Why I use the GPL (May 5, 2014)

Some people in the Jupiter Broadcasting community have recently been dishing out
a lot of hate towards the GPL. I made a new article to defend its controversies.
It's an evolving article. I'll make updates to it whenever new arguments need
debunking.

### Free Software Overhaul (April 29, 2014)

A few weeks ago, my classmate wanted something better for her laptop. She was
complaining about how slow it was while we were working in the lab together. I
idly bragged about "what I could do with a computer," and she asked how much I
would charge to fix hers up...

### Markdown (April 28, 2014)

The site has recently been converted to Markdown, using a converter and style
sheet to make it look so much better than plain old HTML. This is definitely a
step up in my web design career (not really a career, but history). Thanks very
much to Darcy Br&aacute;s da Silva (dardevelin) for the markdown idea and
assistance with some of the trouble I was having with headers and footers.

If you'd like to do something similar with your site, change the `.html`
extension in any page's URL to `.md`. You'll see that it looks very nice even
in plain text form, which is kind of markdown's purpose.
