Hardware Troubleshooting
========================

### Description

Sometimes, there will be bumps in the road when trying to work with certain
hardware. This mostly happens with printers, but internal hardware has hiccups
from time to time depending on the age of the machine and other factors. I can
research the problem and attempt to get your hardware working under your free
operating system.

### Procedure

1. Identify problem device
2. Determine if there is a fix
3. Determine if suggested fix is possible
4. Resolve conflicts
5. Test hardware

### Details

Cost: $60 per hour (no charge if there is no fix)

Time: Unpredictable.

Included:

- Necessary package installation

- Basic configuration (if necessary)

- Simple tests

Reversible: Yes.

Refundable: Yes. If an implemented fix did not work, there is no charge to you.
