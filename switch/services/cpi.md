Custom Package Installation
===========================

### Description

If you need more software than what comes standard on your distribution, I can
install it on your system for you.

### Procedure

1. Assess needs
2. Windows program? If yes, find alternative.
3. Download and install package
4. Test for errors

### Details

Cost: $20 per explicit package (not dependencies)

Time: Variable. Should be less than 5 minutes, but can be longer.

Included:

- Package location and installation

- Quick error checks

- Brief functionality test

Reversible: Yes. Packages are easily installed and uninstalled.

Refundable: No. However, if one package doesn't suit you, but a similar one
does, I will not double-charge you to replace the package.

Note: If there are several packages that you need to install, it would probably
be better to do Fundamental Training instead of this.
