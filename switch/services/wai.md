Windows Application Installation
================================

### Description

If there is a Windows program without an alternative that you cannot live
without, I can _attempt_ to install it using the WINE compatibility layer.

### Procedure

1. Check WineHQ notes
2. Download Windows installer
3. Attempt to install
4. Attempt to run

### Details

Cost: $10 plus [custom package](cpi.html) fee

Time: Unpredictable.

Included:

- Best attempt at installation

- Best attempt at launching

Reversible: Yes. Windows applications can be uninstalled.

Refundable: No. See [Custom Package Installation](cpi.html) for details.

Note: Windows applications often prove difficult to install on GNU/Linux. I make
no guarantees that an application will work correctly or even install.
