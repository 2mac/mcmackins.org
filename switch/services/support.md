Technical Support
=================

### Description

Some users feel more comfortable when there's someone to call if they run into
trouble. I can provide on-call technical support at a low cost with a few
limitations

### Details

Cost: $5 per month flat rate. $60 per hour house calls. $20 restart fee.

Restart fee is incurred when support has been expired for at least 14 days.
House calls only permitted within reasonable distance at my discretion.

Included:

- Unlimited e-mail support

- Phone support during available call hours (see [contact info](/contact.html))

- House calls for special cases

Refundable: No.

Note: This service can be cancelled at will if abused.
