Switching Julie
===============

### April 29, 2014

A few weeks ago, my classmate wanted something better for her laptop. She was
complaining about how slow it was while we were working in the lab together. I
idly bragged about "what I could do with a computer," and she asked how much I
would charge to fix hers up.

Taken aback, I told her I didn't know, but that I was definitely interested. It
was an actual opportunity to bring someone who would have otherwise been
clueless about computers over to free software, which is where they belong.

After a bit of planning, I created a document for her to fill out about what she
wanted out of her system, which was (to my relief) a web browser and a word
processor. Easy peasy. Those both ship standard on
[Linux Mint](http://linuxmint.org). I went home and prepared a flash drive to
install Mint 16 Cinnamon. In a couple of days, we met in the computer lab, and I
performed the installation in front of her so that she could see what I was
doing and so she could enter her own password. After the installation, I gave
her a brief tour of Cinnamon and launching applications. I also installed the
Micro$haft fonts she would need should a professor require Times New Roman font.

By the end of it, I had spent 40 minutes and had installed one custom package
(the fonts), so I later created an invoice for $60, and gave her a 10% discount
for being an easy customer.

So begins my story of switching people to free software. I currently have info
about my process for anyone else who is interested.
