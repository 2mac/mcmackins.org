Contact Me
==========

You can e-mail me at any time at [contact@mcmackins.org][1]. I use GnuPG
(Enigmail) to encrypt my e-mails. If you'd like your e-mails to be truly
private, I encourage you to use it as well. You can request my public key via
e-mail, or you can find it on [this pool](http://pgp.mit.edu/).

If there is an emergency, you may call my cell number. I am best available
between the hours of 5:00 PM and 9:00 PM US Central time during the week.

If you do not have my number, you may request it by e-mail.

You may also find me in on Libera Chat IRC. My username is Zerock.
