    I do have a question for you, though. How do you feel about the OSI as 
    an entity. Do you think they are a "gateway drug" that could influence 
    some extra people into participating in the free software community? Or 
    do you think that they are a hindrance to the FSM?

They do some of each.  I don't know whether the OSI per se has much
effect nowadays.  As for "open source" as a whole, I am convinced we
would be better off if it did not exist.
