    I'm curious as to how you feel about the mobile operating system Firefox
    OS, which, as far as I can tell, is fully released under the MPL, so you
    can actually use a phone in freedom.

From what I've heard, it contains nonfree firmware blobs.  Also, it pushes
the users into confiding their data and their computing to services which
they should not trust.

Skype: No way! That's nonfree (freedom-denying) software. 
Use Ekiga or an ordinary phone call.
