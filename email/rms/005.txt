    In addition to that, I have a question. Since your e-mails (to me) don't 
    really contain personal information that you wouldn't otherwise share 
    with the public, do you mind if I publish verbatim copies of your 
    e-mails to me on that site for discussion with my colleagues?

I agree to that, for these messages.  Please add a reference to
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html, which
I should have put in but forgot to.
