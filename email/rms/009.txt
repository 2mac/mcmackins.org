That's right.  We want to encourage people to use that clause,
and we do so with our facilities.

I think you're taking a big risk to avoid a small risk.

The small risk is that we might make GPLv4 too lax and permit
some things you would rather not permit.

The big risk is that you will get sick, die, be imprisoned,
or just lose interest, and thus not consider upgrading to GPLv4
in 20 years, or GPLv7 in 70 years from now, and thus cause your code
to be incompatible with those GPL versions.

The former is rather unlikely, though I agree it can't be absolutely
ruled out.  The latter gets more and more likely with time.
