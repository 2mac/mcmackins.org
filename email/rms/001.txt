    Despite the cloud of disdain surrounding Microsoft in the FOSS 
    community,

I think of it as the "free software community" -- using the term "FOSS"
doesn't support the free software movement, so I avoid that term.

See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.html for why.

	       they made an appearance at LinuxFest Northwest, and they were 
    said to be one of the most popular booths there.

That is very unfortunate.  The main thing Microsoft does is attack
users' freedom; while it occasionally does some things that are good
(in and of themselves), those are minor side issues.

     Although open-source != free software, it 
    definitely caught my interest that there was any desire at all within 
    the corporation I most criticize to be more open.

I'm not particularly impressed when any company wants to make software
"open", because I think of "open" as a distraction from what really
matters: respect for freedom.

    Do you think that something like this might be the activation energy 
    needed to bring Micro$haft to the ways of good ethics and free software, 
    or do you think this is just an attempt to get the approval of FOSS 
    advocates who would otherwise not buy their products?

The executives who run Microsoft are not influenced by warm and fuzzy
feelings.  They calculate strategies for their profit.  Their PR
department is tasked with influencing the public, not with advising
the executives about software licensing.

They might really a chance of influencing people in our community who
think of it as "open source" or "FOSS", and don't have a clear idea of
the freedom issue or a firm stand for freedom.  Microsoft really does
make some programs free, and they are real contributions.  If a
company did ONLY those things, we could say it was good.  But what
Microsoft wants is for these secondary good deeds to blind us to the
harm and wrong it continues to do.
