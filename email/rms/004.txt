    In light of recent events, you will likely be pleased to find out that I 
    am now an associate member of the FSF.

Thank you for supporting us.

    Since I believe you download web pages to read them, you may want 
    instead a copy of the markdown source which is designed to be easier to

I will take a look.

    I did use the term "Linux" 
    to refer to the operating system two or three times only because it was 
    put that way in the name of the GNU/Linux distributions. I tend to call 
    things what they're named, so those particular ones were referred to as 
    desired by the maintainers.

I follow that principle too, except regarding things I really hate.
(See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-call-it-the-swindle.html.)  I don't
hate most of those distros, though I criticize them.

However, _they violated that very principle themselves_ when they made
a version of GNU/Linux and called it "Something Linux".  Having done
this, they are not entitled to the benefit of that principle from you.

In other words, if they have the cheek to change the name of our
system, why shouldn't we change it back?
