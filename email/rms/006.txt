    I'd like to know how you feel about derivative distros such as Xubuntu 
    that use other desktop environments. Now, I understand that those 
    distros (like so many others) include nonfree software either in 
    userspace or kernelspace. For this e-mail, I'm going to overlook those 
    details; I am purely interested in how you see the derivative Ubuntu 
    distros that don't implement the same kind of spyware.

If a variant of Ubuntu does not spy, the spying issue does not apply
to it.  But we have to be careful in the conclusions we draw from that.

Our priority is to convince the Ubuntu to stop the spying, so that we
can say, "The free software community effectively keeps malware out."

Finding a way to use Ubuntu and not be snooped on is NOT real success.
Success is making Ubuntu stop snooping.

So we should emphasize that Ubuntu does spy, and not be distracted by
the fact that Foobuntu or Goobuntu do not spy.
