You Have a Right to Complain
============================

### Election Day - November 8, 2022

> If you don't vote, you have no right to complain.

I'm not sure when I first heard this sentiment, but I rank it up with the most
overdone memes in American politics. Any time the question of whether someone
should bother participating in the election is raised, I hear this slogan
repeated. It's practically a tautology, a truism accepted by all good American
citizens.

The reasoning behind this sentiment is, perhaps obviously, that in a democratic
society, each citizen has an opportunity to voice their opinion in a very
direct sense by voting. Therefore, if you choose not to participate in an
election, then you forgo this opportunity, and you therefore have no legitimate
basis on which to complain about the political state of affairs in your
country, because you had the opportunity to change the state of things and
decided not to.

Let's consider then the basis for complaints of those who do participate in
elections. If you vote in an election (let's only consider one office for
simplicity's sake), then your selected candidate either wins or loses.

- If they win, then you voted for things to be as they are, so you have no
  right to complain.
- If they lose, then you had your opportunity to voice your opinion, and
  society disagreed with you, so you should stop being a sore loser.

It seems to me, then, that by this logic, nobody has any right to complain at
all! It's just that the people who vote in elections want to feel better about
their decision to vote and shout down people who raise their grievances with
the system because they have no right to complain.

There are many reasons people might choose not to participate in
elections. Maybe they are disgusted by the concept of democracy altogether and
for fear of being a hypocrite they refuse to vote. Maybe they are genuinely
indifferent to the outcome of the election and don't want to waste their
time. Or maybe they just don't like any of the candidates on the ballot. All
that matters is that it's none of your business why someone does or doesn't
vote. Just as free individuals have a right to speak their mind, so do they
also have a right to keep their mouth shut if they so desire, and when they
decide to raise objection to what someone does at a later time, who are you to
tell them that they have no right to their opinion?

Everyone has a right to complain, and even if someone chooses not to decide,
they still have made a choice.
