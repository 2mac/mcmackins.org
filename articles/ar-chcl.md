Arkansas CHCL Prohibited Places
===============================

Arkansas law declares several places in which it is unlawful to carry a
concealed handgun. The way the law reads is somewhat confusing, so I've
compiled a more straightforward list here. This is especially helpful to those
with the enhanced CHCL.

This document is edited from the original law for convenience in understanding
of the reader and is not to be taken as legal advice. This document was last
updated April 19, 2018.
