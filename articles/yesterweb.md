My Thoughts on Yesterweb
========================

### November 23, 2022

Since starting [my photo blog][1], I've been looking around at various sites on
[Neocities][2]. For those who don't know, Neocities is an attempt to revive the
spirit of [GeoCities][3] which was an icon of the early web. [The Yesterweb][4]
is one such site that dedicates itself to the mission of resurrecting the
culture of the old web, sometimes called Web 1.0.

I am partial to this mission. After all, this very site is very much in the Web
1.0 style. I also actively avoid social media sites. About the closest I get to
social media is reddit, and I also occasionally use a Mastodon instance
dedicated to the toki pona conlang. However, Yesterweb has a few
shortcomings. Some of these are situational issues that could be fixed, and
others are fundamentally in conflict with its stated goals. In this article I
will enumerate the issues I see.

Socialist Overtones
-------------------

This is largely a personal gripe but I think it deserves a mention as a real
issue because I think it is counterproductive to their own goals. It is clear
that they want to introduce more people to the web of old. I use the word
"introduce" because most people online today started using the web well after
the dawn of Web 2.0.

One of the most overt instances of socialist leanings is found on their webring
info page:

> If you believe that the internet is being wrongly controlled by capitalism,
> or that social interaction online should be more than it currently is on
> Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, then you belong here.

The "or" in this sentence gives an exemption for non-socialists to still be
welcome, but there is a very clear suggestion here that the problems with the
modern web are the fault of capitalism rather than, say, ignorance of the old
web or the possibility that most people actually prefer the modern web.

Another instance that at first seemed like an oddity is the "anti-capitalism"
tag in their web directory. For instance, one of the entries in their directory
is a site dedicated to listing alternative online stores to Amazon. I am
absolutely on board with avoiding Amazon and supporting small businesses, but
this site was tagged as an anti-capitalist website... even though its primary
goal is to direct you to stores that operate for profit.

It seems to me that the people in charge of the Yesterweb are bitten by the
socialist memes that all the worst parts of our society are the core tenets of
capitalism, and resisting huge corporations that are in bed with the government
for unfair advantage is somehow anti-capitalist. It's weird, and I think it
attracts similarly confused socialists into their fold and repels people who
would otherwise be interested in participating but don't appreciate the
politics.

Platform Hypocrisy
------------------

Like any good community, the Yesterweb operates on many auxiliary platforms
where a plain old website isn't sufficient. Among these platforms is Discord
for real-time chat. The folks at Yesterweb are so embarrassed by this decision
that they even wrote [an article][5] attempting to justify their choice.

tl;dr: most internet users are already using it

Isn't that true of all the other online services that Yesterweb is trying to
retreat from? The obvious choice for a real-time chat platform for a community
whose goal is to return to the purer net from the 90s and early 00s is
[IRC][6]. In their justification article, they acknowledge the existence of IRC
but write it off because it, among other decentralized platforms, allegedly are
bastions of hate speech, because that's what free speech is, apparently. Never
mind the fact that they could run their own channel or even their own IRC
network with their own set of rules if they wanted.

I see this as a cheap compromise on their principles that could be easily
overcome if they weren't more interested in political grandstanding.

A Fundamental Meta Issue
------------------------

As much as I like hearing other people express their nostalgia for the web of
yesteryear, I can't help but notice a glaring problem with Yesterweb: their
very existence is essentially to complain about the modern web.

Yesterweb has published a quarterly zine for about a year now. In their fourth
issue, there are still multiple articles which are essentially someone telling
their story about the early days of the web and how the modern web doesn't live
up to it. [The article I read][7] was well written, and I enjoyed reading it,
but I think the main reason I enjoyed reading it is because I hadn't read any
of the other issues or articles. I don't see myself clamoring for the latest
issue of a zine going over the same old things forever.

Really the fundamental issue is that Yesterweb does not really contribute to
the thing it is trying to promote. The best it offers is its site directory
which at least points people to interesting sites to explore, but the old ways
aren't going to be accepted unless there are more interesting things to do!
It reminds me a lot of many atheist and anti-feminist YouTube channels from
years ago: they have a message for people who haven't heard it before, but you
quickly exhaust everything they have to say. This wouldn't be a problem if it
weren't for one simple fact: they keep saying it!

It is a double-edged sword. On one hand, they need to continue putting out new
material for people to stumble across, but on the other, they neglect their
existing audience's wishes for something new to hear about. Yesterweb faces the
same issue. I see them continuing to be a gateway for new eyes to see that
people long for the net gone by, but they will be quickly forgotten except for
things like the directory which are genuinely helpful.
